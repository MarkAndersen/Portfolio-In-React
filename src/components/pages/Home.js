        Hi! My name is Mark Andersen, I am an aspiring web developer currently
        participating in the Full Stack Uconn bootcamp. I have an extensive
        background in retail I currently manage the Services and Fulfillment
        departments at my local Home Depot. I graduated from Western Connecticut
        State University in the fall of 2015 with a B.S. in Meteorology. I am
        looking to tie in the skills I acquire during this program with my
        educational background studying and forecasting weather.
